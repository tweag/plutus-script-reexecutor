## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We want to store the results of scripts execution for future usage.

## Decision

- We decided to use SQLite because:

    1. The whole database is just a file, no need to add one more running service.

    2. Familiar query language

- We decided to use `sqlite-simple` Haskell library:

    1. To keep the number of dependencies small.

    2. It's easy to easy and allows to write SQL queries manually.

    3. It supports parameterised queries, avoiding SQLi issues.

    4. We don't see the need in ORM libraries at this point as we use only one database and the schema
        and queries we have are very simple so the development and dependency overhead of a higher level
        library isn't needed currently.

## Consequences

- Writing SQL queries might be tedious and at some point might need to be refactored.

- We don't use compile-time queries which can lead to runtime errors.
